# Switch
Game revolving around matching tile colors. 
# How To Play
Each tile is generated with a random pattern that repeats itself. Clicking a tile will cause all the other tiles to cycle through the pattern once. <br/>
For example, suppose we have 2 tiles, Tile A and Tile B. Here is an example sequence: <br/>
A: Blue Blue Red Blue <br/>
B: Blue Green Blue <br/>
By holding 'B' constant, we can cycle the tiles until they are both blue.
